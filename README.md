Data Structures and Algos

This repo. contains the most used data structures and algos. with a basic implementation.
It also allows me to reference when I need to to refresh my memory about a data structure or algorithm, or just copy-paste the basic implementation and edit for my use at that moment instead of rewritting from 0 everytime.
